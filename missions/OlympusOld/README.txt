Warning: Using the pistol course or basic training targets requires a dedicated server in order to operate properly.  
	 To use these, you cannot preview from the editor, as they will not work.

To use: Select the weapon you want to use (any will work for now).  Make sure there is a magazine loaded to any amount.
	Step up to the line, and fire at the targets as they pop up.  The targets are currently randomized.  

	The test length is determined by the **initial** amount of ammo in your weapon's magazine when you registered to start the course.

	At the end of the course, your accuracy as a percentage (targets hit / targets raised) will be displayed as a private global chat message to you.

Additional Features: The course keeps track of your current weapon.  If you change weapons, you fail the course and your stats are not displayed.
                     The course keeps track of who is shooting.  If any other player attempts to shoot the targets, 
		     you fail the course and your stats are not displayed.
